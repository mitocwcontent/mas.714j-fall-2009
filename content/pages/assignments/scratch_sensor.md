Getting Set Up
--------------

To download the driver you'll need to make your Scratch Board work, visit the [Picoboard Web site](http://www.picocricket.com/whichpicoboard.html).

On the Scratch Web site, former MAS714 students have graciously documented processes they used to build Hook-ups. The project links below will give you a glimpse into how several students linked physical creations to Scratch projects through sensor boards.
